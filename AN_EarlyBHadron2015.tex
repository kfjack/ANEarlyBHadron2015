% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been

% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.

\abstract{ 
Measurements of the total and differential cross sections with respect to transverse momentum and rapidity for $B^+$ mesons produced in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13 TeV$ are presented, with a data set correspond to an integrated luminosity of xxx inverse picobarns collected by the CMS detector. The exclusive decay $B^+ \to J/\psi K^+$, with $J/\psi$ meson decaying to a pair of muons, is used to reconstruct $B^+$ mesons. The production cross section of $B^+$ hadron is measured as a function of the transverse momentum and rapidity.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text (no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
