\section{Yield Extraction}
\label{sec:yieldextraction}

% KFC: need to describe the ML fit here

We extract signal yields in bins of $p_T^B$ and $|y^B|$ bin using a data-driven unbinned extended maximum-likelihood fit to the invariant mass of 
the reconstructed $B$-meson candidate. The likelihood for each event is obtained by summing the product of yield and probability density for each of the signal and background hypotheses. We assume the existence of five separate components including signal, $B^+\to J/\psi \pi^+$, prompt $J/\psi$, non-prompt  $J/\psi$, and combinatorial events.
